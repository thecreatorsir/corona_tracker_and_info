                Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused
                by a newly discovered coronavirus. Most people infected with the
                COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory
                illness and recover without requiring special treatment. Older
                people, and those with underlying medical problems like
                cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease,
                and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. The best
                way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well informed
                about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it
                spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing
                your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not
                touching your face. The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through
                droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected
                person coughs or sneezes, so it’s important that you also
                practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a
                flexed elbow). At this time, there are no specific vaccines or
                treatments for COVID-19. However, there are many ongoing
                clinical trials evaluating potential treatments. WHO will
                continue to provide updated information as soon as clinical
                findings become available.

                      They found two strains, which they named L and S. The S
                      type is older, but the L type was more common in early
                      stages of the outbreak. They think one may cause more
                      cases of the disease than the other, but they’re still
                      working on what it all means.

                It depends on many things, including researchers’ work to learn
                more about the virus, their search for a treatment and a
                vaccine, and the public’s efforts to slow the spread.

                      More than 100 vaccine candidates are in various stages of
                      development and testing. This process usually takes years.
                      Researchers are speeding it up as much as they can, but it
                      still might take 12 to 18 months to find a vaccine that
                      works and is safe.
